              "The SSA1 / SSA2 is a Z-Wave enabled device that will sound a loud siren and/or flash a strobe light when signaled via a Z-Wave enabled network. SSA1: clear lens version; SSA2: red lens version.Integrate it into the home automation and/ or security network, and this siren/strobe module will deliver the audible and visual notifications you can depend on.\n- SSA will sound a loud audible alarm >110dB@1m and a strobe lighting when an alarm signal is received from a device in the Z-Wave home network. \n- Intended for use inside a Z-Wave Home Automation network as a Siren / Strobe Light Alarm.\n\n- Can be used in a normal, existing homeâ€™s security system with wired controllers, using  Z-Wave to RS-232/485 bridge.\n\n- Extends the range of existing Z-Wave devices in the mesh network by acting as a signal repeater.\n\n- Uses the latest and most successful wireless home automation technology.\n\n- Tamper proof.  Uses 9V batter backup to sound alarm if AC power is disconnected / cut.\n- SSA is fully programmable with Z-wave smart controllers to provide the audible and visual notifications you set for your automation and/or security network.\n\n    - Siren ONLY mode\n\n    - Strobe ONLY mode\n\n    - Strobe & Siren Mode",
