              "This solar powered outdoor siren can be used without any additional power supply or batteries. It can be installed on any place on the outside of the house and can be controlled using Z-Wave. The device will issue a very loud sound (105 dBm) and in parallel some stroboscope light as well. The siren is self-protecting. Removing the main device from the mounting unit immediately starts the siren and also reports the tamper attempt to the Z-Wave central controller. All communication between the Z-Wave controller and the siren is encrypted and secured to protect against manipulation.  Thanks to the large solar panel the siren can be mounted on nearly every place outside the house, with direct or indirect sun light. The siren is maintenance-free and water-proofed (IP56). The average solar energy of one day keeps the device alive for up to 50 days (without using the siren). Additionally an internal temperature sensor reports the temperature inside the sirenâ€™s enclosure.",
