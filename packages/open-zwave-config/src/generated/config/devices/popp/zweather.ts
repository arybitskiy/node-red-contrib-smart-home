              "Z-Weather is a  multisensor device monitoring outside weather and environmental conditions. It continually measures the wind speed and can, for example, trigger closing of the awning and blinds if it is too windy. It also measures the amount of rotation, enabling calculation of the wind yield per day or per year. In addition, Z-Weather includes sensors for humidity, temperature, pressure and dew point, essentially providing the core sensors of a weather station.\nZ-Weather is powered by a solar cell and stores energy on an internal capacitor, enabling continuous operation, even with no wind for a couple of days. It does not use any batteries and is completely maintenance free. Using the built-in solar cell it also measures the ambient light and the solar yield. This information can be used to turn on the outdoor light at dusk time and turn the light off in the morning.\nZ-Weatherâ€˜s wind yield and solar yield metering can be used as a calculation base for planning a wind generator or a solar panel on the roof of a house.",
