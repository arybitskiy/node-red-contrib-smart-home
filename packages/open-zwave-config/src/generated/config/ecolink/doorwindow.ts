Refer to the instructions provided by the manufacturer of your specific controller for details on initiating the controllerâ€™s inclusion mode. \n\nSTEP ONE  \t     Start by placing the controller into inclusion mode.\n\nSTEP TWO\t    Activate inclusion mode for the sensor by removing the plastic pull-tab from the back of the sensor.  When the\n    inclusion process is complete, the LED on the sensor will be solid blue, then go out.\n\nSTEP THREE    Test the sensor.  Place the magnet next to the sensor to represent a closed position (see Installation section \n\t      to see where to position the magnet).  If the LED flashes ONE TIME, it is successfully communicating on your \n\t      Zwave network.  If the LED on the sensor flashes slow and steady for 5 seconds, you need to repeat the \n\t      inclusion process.",
