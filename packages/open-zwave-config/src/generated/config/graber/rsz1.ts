Lighting control has never been more simple. Window treatments can be automated using your favorite Z-Wave certified gateway or security system, or controlled by a remote control.  Raise or lower the shades to control just the right amount of light, privacy and solar heat. Shades can be fully open, fully closed or anywhere in between, itâ€™s up to you.  In addition, some systems will also report back the state of the battery charge on battery operated versions.",

The Wakeup interval can be configured to any value from 6 minutes to 25 hours. Recommendation is to leave the interval at the default of 12 hours to maximize battery life. The remote will wake up every WakeUpInterval and send a WakeUp Notification command as well as a battery report to the NodeID assigned with the Interval Set command. The WakeUp Notification will be sent within a few minutes of power being applied to the remote and then once every Wake Up Interval. A Wakeup Interval Capabilities command will inform the hub of the default, minimum, maximum and step size of the Wake Up interval.",
