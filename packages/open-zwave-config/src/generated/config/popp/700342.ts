              "This products consists of a standard high-quality photo electric Smoke detector with a pluggable Z-Wave wireless interface module. The Smoke detector will also work as a stand alone product and is certified as '10 year Smoke Detector' The smoke chamber of the detector has a stainless steel reel with antistatic plastic chamber. A button allows on-device test of smoke chamber, electronics and battery. The device also offers a built-in self test and an electronic smoke chamber test to avoid the use of test aerosol. A low battery warning will last for 30 days but full function of the detector is guaranteed during this time. The Z-Wave module allows to report the smoke and low battery alarm wirelessly to a central controller.",
